<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>Hello and welcome to my webpage. I am a graduate student who enjoys learning about economic history and (inter)national politics. I wanted to make a blog for several reasons.</p>

<p>First and foremost as a public good: I believe that the internet is fantastic but also overcrowded with content. I propose that we could all work together to design tools and
    resources which make the web simpler and more navigable. If you would like to explore the tools/resources current available, please click here. If you share my vision,
    don't hesitate to reach out here.</p>
    
 <p>Secondly for self-interested reasons: I think the internet could be a great way to interact with people who have a better understanding of politics and economics than I and to
    - as it were - 'complete' my knowledge of these subjects. It is also a rather neat way to show people what I have done and where I would like to go, and to get advise on that
    journey.</p>
    
 <p>Thirdly for sentimental reasons. Fourthly and finally to write opinionated blog posts and to revise and refine my views accordingly.</p>

<h1>My vision</h1>
<p>I want to clarify what I mean by 'the internet is fantastic but also overcrowded with content'. I think one of the greatest political challenges of our times is the rise of
    'hyper-polarization'. It brings the absurd theatre of dysfunctional democracy into our everyday lives. It stifles debate and discussion. It rewards bad actors. It threatens
    the foundational values of our societies. But it is very difficult or impossible for ordinary people to escape if they want to participate in the world.</p>

 <p>I think the phenomena of 'hyper-polarization' is frighteningly robust, and we should first be realistic about what we can do about it. We cannot organize in decisive numbers from
    such an obscure corner of the internet, but we can try to protect ourselves against it and rediscover our foundational values. We can choose to form our opinions when and how we want
    to (or choose not to form them). We can stand for foundation principles, rather than sides, when we do not have the full information. We can be pragmatic, but not too pragmatic. We can be
    principled, but not dogmatic. We can identify bad actors without discrediting 'sides'.</p>

  <p>Let's be realistic again. The first priority is to stop the information overload. Social media is (generally) not a great way to learn about world affairs. It is better to read two reliable news
    sources rather than a half-dozen unreliable sources. If you find yourself 'doomscrolling', perhaps a reliable news source could email you a summary of top stories. The second priority is to make your 
    <i>own</i> choice about what information is reliable. Ask yourself - if you were forced to buy a print newspaper for the price of a cup of coffee, which would you instictively choose? If you weren't sure,
    wouldn't you want to learn something about its Code of Practice first? About its history of publishing blunders compared to other newspapers? Maybe you want to challenge your instincts anyway and go ahead
    and read a few publishers' Code of Practice? The third and final priority is to simplify, simplify, simplify. Perhaps a specific story is overrepresented, or underrepresented, and you want a tool which can correct the
    balance. We can do that with a few lines of web code. Perhaps images or videos are pull you away from the news. We can blur or remove them using easily installable web tools.</p>
